“The Forsyte Saga” was the title originally destined for that part of it which
is called “The Man of Property”; and to adopt it for the collected chronicles
of the Forsyte family has indulged the Forsytean tenacity that is in all of
us. The word Saga might be objected to on the ground that it connotes the
heroic and that there is little heroism in these pages. But it is used with a
suitable irony; and, after all, this long tale, though it may deal with folk
in frock coats, furbelows, and a gilt-edged period, is not devoid of the
essential heat of conflict. Discounting for the gigantic stature and
blood-thirstiness of old days, as they have come down to us in fairy-tale and
legend, the folk of the old Sagas were Forsytes, assuredly, in their
possessive instincts, and as little proof against the inroads of beauty and
passion as Swithin, Soames, or even Young Jolyon. And if heroic figures, in
days that never were, seem to startle out from their surroundings in fashion
unbecoming to a Forsyte of the Victorian era, we may be sure that tribal
instinct was even then the prime force, and that “family” and the sense of
home and property counted as they do to this day, for all the recent efforts
to “talk them out.”
